# Predicting Inpatient Length of Stay from NYC Metro Hospitals (2011-2016)

Objective: Use machine learning regression models to predict length of hospital stay with 5 years of New York State SPARCS, de-identified patient discharge data

ABSTRACT: Predicting length of stay for hospital patients extends beyond economic or logistical concerns. 
While mostly hospital or region specific, previous models of prediction have been demonstrably robust and accurate when measured against discharge data. 
I propose applying machine learning (ML) regression techniques to better understand drivers of length of stay past hospital admission.
Results from this work could complement healthcare professionalsâ€™ in triaging patient care and support more efficient allocation of resources. 



This project will include:
1) R code used to import and analyze this data (carried out in R Studio IDE), 
2) Brief explanation and rationalization for each step of analysis to improve my own learning and operate with transparency,
3) Visualizations as well as suggested next steps for contextualizing the results

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions concerning this project. I welcome all feedback, especially interest in collaboration!
